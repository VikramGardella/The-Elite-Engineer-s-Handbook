# The-Elite-Engineer-s-Handbook
The is a rough draft of an outline for a handbook I plan to digitalize and make open-source that every engineer and STEM scholar should always have handy.

Outline:

-Physics
  -Kinematics
    -basics for linear motion (derivatives of displacement vs. time)
    -momentum/impulse + energy + work + power (make note that "work" = "torque" which will be covered under "kinematics->rotational motion" later on
    -rotational motion
      -angular displacement & accelarion vs time
      -rotational momentum: "moment of inertia"
      -torque
  -Calorimetry & Thermochemistry
    -enthalpy of vaporization etc.
  -Fluid Dynamics
    -Inert Gas Law
  -Thermodynamics
  -Electricity
    -current/resistance/voltage intro
    -alternating current vs direct current
    -Electric potential concept
    -solving circuits in series
    -solving circuits in parallel
    -solving more complex circuits with both series and parallel part of their composition
    -Karnaugh maps to find most efficient blueprint for logic gates in circuit
    -Pulse-Width Modulation to vary power and/or speed of electrical motor/device with analogous input
  -Magnetism
    -emf
    -"F-I-B hand trick" (force vs current vs magnetic field vector relations by taking hand and emulating the Fonze - saying "ayeeee!" is optional but never a bad move 9/10)
  -Wave Science
    -Transverse waves (ie. light/electromagnetic)
    -Snell's Law
    -Malus Law
    -Longitudinal Waves (ie. sound)
      -compression vs stretch
      -doppler effect and equations
