# The-Elite-Engineer-s-Handbook
The is a rough draft of an outline for a handbook I plan to digitalize and make open-source that every engineer and STEM scholar should always have handy.

Outline:

-Physics
  -Kinematics
    -basics for linear motion (derivatives of displacement vs. time)
    -momentum/impulse + energy + work + power (make note that "work" = "torque" which will be covered under "kinematics->rotational motion" later on
    -rotational motion
      -angular displacement & accelarion vs time
      -rotational momentum: "moment of inertia"
      -torque
  -Calorimetry & Thermochemistry
    -enthalpy of vaporization etc.
  -Fluid Dynamics
    -Inert Gas Law
  -Thermodynamics
  -Wave Science
    -Transverse waves (ie. light/electromagnetic)
    -Snell's Law
    -Malus Law
    -Longitudinal Waves (ie. sound)
      -compression vs stretch
      -doppler effect and equations
